# Contributions

Hey, if you're here and reading this page, it means you have some interest in helping out with the development of Stardust-Engine!

Right now, Stardust-Engine is in a lot of development and changes quite frequently - and in order to keep track of contributions and changes, I'd really appreciate it if you could create a tracking issue for your work and introduce a pull request when you believe you are finished. 

Once a pull request is initiated, I (@NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies) will review your contribution - make suggestions and changes - and eventually you will get your features added if they conform to overall project goals.
